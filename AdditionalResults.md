# BACKGROUND

- **Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs)** aim to prescribe treatment plans at various stages based on an individual's time-varying characteristics.
- Learning DTRs through direct interaction with clinical environments is often impractical due to ethical constraints, necessitating the use of offline data from pre-collected electronic health records.
- The presence of unobserved confounders arising from incomplete patient records could result in biased treatment policies.
